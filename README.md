<b> Electoral Race on Reddit </b> 

This year's electoral race has been discussed extensively on Reddit, an online forum that calls itself "the front page of the internet". Having a look in the relation between topics, communities and Redditors is going to enhance a political understanding of the race for the presidency 

With PRAW, a Python wrapper for the Reddit API, we have a tool to pull data and explore the following questions:

<b>- Do Redditors contribute to “hot topics” across the subreddits?</b> 
This will be the first step to find data across subreddits and find links between subreddits.

<b>- What are the differences in “hot topics” across the political spectrum? </b> 
This will require us to make a heatmap of keywords used in each subreddit. 

<b>- What are the most controversial topics within each community? </b> 
This will require us to define controversial, perhaps in terms of the ratio of positive to negative comments to a post. Defining this will require us to look into keywords in each comment to label them as positive or negative.

<b>- How does sentiment differ towards hot topics across subreddits? </b> 
This will require us to identify hot topics, and then do a sentiment analysis of the comments on each related topics.
